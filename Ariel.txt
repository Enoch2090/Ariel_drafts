Stasis in darkness. Men the substanceless blue
Pour of tor and distances.
God's lioness, how one we grow!

Pivot of heels and knees! -The furrow
Splits and passes,
Sister to the brown arc.
Of the neck I cannot catch
Nigger-eye

Berries, multiplying, 
cast dark hooks, but do not catch.
Black sweet blood mouthfuls!

Some thing else
Hauls me through air,
Flakes from my heels.

And now I
Foam to blight wheat, a glitter of seas,

The child's cry
Melts in the wall, and I
am the arrow, the dew that flies
Suicidal, at one
with the drive
into the red
Eye, into the cauldron of morning.
